# WDI_PROJECT_3
Project 3 for WDI

##Initial Idea

We started the project by brainstorming ideas at the pub and then the next day in a more formal manner. After discussing a few ideas we had ideas for a dating app, a news app and a books app. We later discussed our idea with Alex who pushed us to develop our idea and make it more interactive with the user, after which we decided to settle on a book-tracing app, where users can add a book to the website and then release it into the wild where other readers can pick up the book and comment further on the website about the book’s story and its journey. 

For our project we used trello to organise our tasks between the five of us. For the start, Henry and James worked on setting up an authentication system. After setting up the authentication, we divided our tasks of building the app into front-end and back-end. The back-end group worked on setting up the express app and the angular set up. Meanwhile the other group worked on designing wireframes and then building the html pages for the users, index, home page, and add a book page.

##Production

On Tuesday we spent some time working on a bug related to installing angular Slick carousel. We understood that the issue was installing an outdated version of Slick which didn’t match our current setup.
