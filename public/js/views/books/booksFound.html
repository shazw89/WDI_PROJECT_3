  <p>If you so happen to find a freed book, don’t panic. You can keep it… for a time. Just tell us when you’ve found one and enter the unique code that comes with the book. And then leave a comment about the book on its profile. All our books have a storied past and we like to keep it that way. Then set it free again after you’re done. Warning: if it so much as touches the dreaded shelf, we will know.</p>
